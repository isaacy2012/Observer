## Observe helps you collect and visualise feedback
We noticed from our courses at university that there wasn't an easy way to provide anonymous feedback when feedback was needed and a way indicate which areas of feedback people felt strongly about, and so we decided to make Observe. 

## Create your own rooms to poll for feedback
People can join your room via a link or by entering the pin code of the room. 

## Visualise feedback
A color gradient from grey to green shows what feedback people agree with the most. 

## Features
- Write notes of feedback and add them to the page.
- Like posted notes with liked notes become greener.
- View all previously posted notes in an easy-to-read grid pattern.

## Technology 
- TypeScript/React for the front-end
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ckgnSORLxTf31YEWymSS4a/Observer?node-id=0%3A1) for design prototyping
- Amazon EC2 server
- MongoDB database
